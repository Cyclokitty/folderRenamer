Folder Contents Renamer
=============

## Why This Project?
I'm trying out the different file methods in Node.js.

Renaming files can be messy and time consuming and since javascript is my fav (ok, only language so far), I want to use Node.js to do this task.

This project uses npm glob, as well as the node.js path and fs methods. 

## To Run:

node app.js

## Note:

Be sure to change the doc names to the appropriate file names

## Extra Note:

This does rename all of the contents of a folder fulls of documents.
